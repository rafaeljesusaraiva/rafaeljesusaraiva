## 💁  Systems Administrator and Programming & Robotics Workshop Leader @ TUMO

- 📚  Study Computer Engineering at [Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra](isec.pt)!
- 🔭  I'm now redoing all the infrastucture (hardware & software) for my [website][website] (currently down)!
- 🌱  Always learning something new!
- 🥅  __2025 Objective (Hardware):__ Develop a infotainment system with two screens (instrument cluster and media display), custom PCBs and 3D models, with added sensors+cameras for tracking driving habits (GPS, accelerometer, sonar, compass, gyroscope), analysing the data with AI for better route optimization and suggestions for day-to-day travel.
- 🥅  __2025 Objective (Web):__ Create a all-in-one online platform for my website, schedules and appointments with clients.
- ⚡  __Fun fact about me:__ I do photography and video professionally and learned almost everything I know now by myself!
